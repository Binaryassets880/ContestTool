# Grand Arena 50/50 Contest Strategy Guide

Based on analysis of **23,590 scored matches** with full fantasy point tracking.

## TL;DR - Quick Strategy

1. **Wins are everything** - A win adds 300+ FP, the difference between winners (545 FP avg) and losers (153 FP avg) is massive
2. **Use Matchup Score (MS)** - Pick champions with MS 55+ whenever possible
3. **Strikers are your safety net** - They score 150+ FP even when losing (via deposits)
4. **Defenders are high-risk/high-reward** - Great when they win (65% win rate), terrible floor when they lose

## The Math: Why Wins Matter So Much

| Outcome | Average FP | Stat-Only FP |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Win** | 544.5 | 244.5 |
| **Loss** | 152.8 | 152.8 |
| **Difference** | **391.7** | 91.7 |

**Key Insight**: Winners score 91.7 more stat points than losers on average. This is because the winning team is actively eliminating/depositing while losers are being eliminated.

The 300-point win bonus is equivalent to:
- 3.75 eliminations (80 pts each)
- 6 deposits (50 pts each)
- 533 wart distance units

**Bottom Line**: A champion with 70% win probability is worth more than a champion with better raw stats but 40% win probability.

## Class Breakdown

### Tier 1: Best Average FP
| Class | Avg FP | Win Rate | Floor (P10) | Main Scoring |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Defender | 358.3 | 56.3% | 18.1 | Wart (120 pts) + Wins |
| Sprinter | 355.2 | 51.1% | 78.7 | Wart (113 pts) + Elims |
| Striker | 353.1 | 41.0% | 150.0 | Deposits (228 pts!) |

### Tier 2: Moderate
| Class | Avg FP | Win Rate | Floor (P10) | Main Scoring |

## The Floor vs Ceiling Trade-off

### High Floor Classes (Consistent)
**Strikers** have the best floor because they score via **deposits** which happen consistently:
- Average 4.57 deposits per game = 228 FP from deposits alone
- Even in losses, they're depositing while trying to catch up
- P10 floor: 150 FP (you almost never score below this)

### High Ceiling Classes (Win-Dependent)
**Defenders** have the best average but worst floor:
- High win rate (56.3%) means they often get the 300 pt bonus
- Score via wart distance (120 pts avg) which requires staying alive
- When they lose, they often score very little (P10: 18 FP)

## 50/50 Strategy

In 50/50 contests, you need to beat ~50% of the field. Here's how to think about it:

### Scenario Analysis

**If everyone picks Defenders:**
- ~56% of Defenders win → score ~500+ FP
- ~44% of Defenders lose → score ~100 FP
- You need to be in the winning 56%

**If you pick 2 Defenders + 2 Strikers:**
- Your Strikers provide floor protection (~150 FP even in losses)
- Your Defenders provide upside when they win
- More consistent total lineup FP

### Optimal Lineup Compositions

| Strategy | Classes | Expected Avg | Floor (P10) | Best When |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Safe** | 4x Strikers | 1412 | 600 | Uncertain matchups |
| **Balanced** | 2 Defenders + 2 Strikers | 1423 | 336 | Mixed MS slate |
| **Aggressive** | 4x Defenders | 1433 | 72 | All 4 have MS 65+ |
| **Mixed** | Defender + Striker + Grinder + Sprinter | 1415 | 327 | Diversified |

### The Key Insight

**For 50/50 contests:**
1. Identify which champions have MS 60+ (favorable matchups)
2. For those slots, pick any class - the win probability is high
3. For uncertain matchups (MS 45-55), prefer **Strikers or Grinders** for floor protection
4. Avoid champions with MS <45 regardless of class

## Using Matchup Score Effectively

| MS Range | Expected Win Rate | Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **70+** | ~65-70% | Pick ANY class, favor Defenders for upside |
| **60-69** | ~60-65% | Safe to pick, any class works |
| **55-59** | ~55-60% | Lean toward Strikers/Grinders for safety |
| **50-54** | ~50-55% | Only pick if great raw stats |
| **<50** | ~45-50% | Avoid unless forced |

## Practical Lineup Building

### Step 1: Check Matchup Scores
Look at the Upcoming tab, sort by Expected Wins or Avg Score.

### Step 2: Identify Strong Matchups
Find 4 champions with MS 55+ if possible.

### Step 3: Prioritize Win Probability
Between two champions:
- Champion A: MS 65, Striker, Avg FP 350
- Champion B: MS 50, Defender, Avg FP 380

**Pick Champion A** - the 15-point MS advantage = ~10% better win probability = ~30 expected FP from win bonus alone.

### Step 4: Fill with Floor Protection
If you have uncertain matchups, fill with Strikers to protect your floor.

## Summary Decision Tree

```
Is MS 60+?
├─ YES → Pick this champion (any class is fine)
│        └─ If choosing between 60+ champions, prefer Defenders
└─ NO → Is MS 55-59?
        ├─ YES → Pick if Striker or Grinder (floor protection)
        │        └─ Skip if Defender/Bruiser (too risky)
        └─ NO → Skip this champion unless no alternatives
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Win probability > raw stats** - The 300 pt win bonus dominates
2. **Matchup Score is your best tool** - Use it to predict wins
3. **Strikers are safety plays** - 150+ FP floor via deposits
4. **Defenders are boom/bust** - Great average, terrible floor
5. **For 50/50s, consistency wins** - A safe 350 FP beats volatile 200-500 range
6. **Mix your lineup** - 2 safe (Strikers) + 2 upside (Defenders/Sprinters)
